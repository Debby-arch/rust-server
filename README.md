Rust TCP Echo Server
Overview

This Rust project implements a simple TCP echo server that listens on 127.0.0.1:6000 for incoming connections. It spawns a new thread for each connected client, handling incoming messages and echoing them back to the client.

Key Features:

Non-blocking TCP listener
Concurrent handling of multiple clients using threads
Basic error handling and logging
Message size limitation (32 bytes)

Usage:

Compile: cargo build --release

Run: ./target/release/your_executable

Connect to the server using a TCP client (e.g., telnet 127.0.0.1 6000) and send messages.

Code Structure:

main.rs: Contains the main entry point and server setup logic.

Dependencies: std::io, std::net, std::sync, and std::thread.

Limitations:

Basic error handling. Consider implementing more robust error handling for production environments.

Limited message size. Adjust MSG_SIZE as needed.

No data validation or security measures. Implement appropriate checks for production use.


Potential Improvements:

Add support for TLS encryption.

Implement a more efficient message handling mechanism.

Improve error handling and logging.

Add configuration options for the server.
